This is a minimal example of a book based on R Markdown and **bookdown** (https://github.com/rstudio/bookdown).

This uses the `bs4_book()` template for HTML and then for getting a PDF

* tweaks of the HTML and merging of all chapters
* some print CSS
* pagedjs-cli.

Why use this and not LaTeX?

* procrastination?
* not having to redefine colors, environments for the LaTeX output
* not having to knit the same Rmd's twice for the two outputs.
